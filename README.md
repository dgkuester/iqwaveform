A python module for analysis and visualization of complex-valued waveforms.

This is early in development and APIs may change rapidly.

## Setup and install
This code is being developed in an anaconda python 3.9 environment, of vintage late 2021. The code has not yet been evaluated for version compatibility, though coding style is meant to support python 3.7 and newer.

Installation of the current git version directly from the web:

```sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/usnistgov/iqwaveform
```

Installation from a local copy of the repository:

```sh
    pip install <path to local copy of repository>
```

## Future work: Requirements to post public repositories to [usnistgov][gh-nst]

Use of this resource by NIST employees is subject to the
[Rules of Behavior for GitHub (PDF)][gh-rob]. For details, please
